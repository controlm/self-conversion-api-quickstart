## Online Documentation
You can find the latest Control-M self-conversion documentation, including a programming guide, on the [**project web page**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/ctmselfconv/control-m-self-conversion-817142681.html).

## Contribution guide
To contribute, please follow these guidelines.

### Files, folders and naming conventions
1. Every sample and its associated files must be contained in its own **folder**. Name this folder something that describes what your sample does. Usually this naming pattern looks like **level-sample-purpose** (e.g. 201-automate-corrective-flow). Numbering should start at 101. 100 is reserved for things that need to be at the top.
2. For consistent ordering **create all folders in lowercase**.
3. Include a **README.md** file that explains the sample. A good description helps other community members to understand your sample. The README.md uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting text. If you want to add images to your README.md file, store the images in the **images** folder. Reference the images in the README.md with a relative path (e.g. `![alt text](images/sampleImage.png "Sample Image Text")`). This ensures the link will reference the target repository if the source repository is forked.
